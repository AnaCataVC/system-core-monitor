### 1. Project Description
**System Core Monitor v3.3.0** is an interactive desktop command center and telemetry suite built exclusively with compiled C# 13 and Windows Presentation Foundation (.NET 9 WPF). It monitors and actively manages critical system resources—**CPU, Memory (RAM), Multi-Drive Storage, Network Latency & Throughput, Real-Time Processes, AI Agents & Model Context Protocol (MCP) Sessions, AI Transcript Retention & Storage Maintenance, Windows Services, Scheduled Tasks, Startup Applications, and Hardware Accelerators (GPU/NPU)**—packaged into a single standalone `.exe` (687 KB) without third-party runtimes or background services.

### 2. ⚡ Command Center & Action Buttons Reference

System Core Monitor transitions from a passive observer to an **Active Command Center**. Below is the exact behavior and Win32/Kernel API mechanism behind every interactive control in the HUD:

| Action / Button | UI Location | Mechanism & Native Win32 / Kernel API | Exact Behavior & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🚀 Turbo Mode** | Top Ribbon / Tray | Win32 `PowrProf.dll` (`PowerSetActiveScheme`) + `EmptyWorkingSet` | Instantly switches the Windows power plan to **High Performance** (unparking CPU cores) and concurrently purges idle working set memory pages across user processes to reclaim physical RAM. |
| **🤖 AI Agent & MCP Monitor** | AI Agents Tab | Win32 `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` + `SafeProcessHandle` + `_sampleGate` + PID Reuse Gate + Snapshot Resilience | Discovers AI developer CLIs (`claude.exe`, `gemini.exe`, `codex.exe`, `aider.exe`, `ollama.exe`, `cursor.exe`, `antigravity.exe`), identifies resumed CLI sessions via hash/UUID (`--resume=`, `🔗 Sesión <8-char-hash>`), displays dynamic AI Model badges (`--model`, `🧬 <ModelName>`), decouples total child processes (`ChildProcessCount`) from verified MCP servers (`McpServersCount`), isolates ephemeral launchers (`npx`, `uvx`), detects Go/Rust compiled MCP binaries via CLI markers, promotes independent CLI sessions with tree boundary truncation, guards snapshot cache-eviction (`allRunningPids.Count > 0`), and dynamically reflects Active (Emerald `#10B981`) vs. Idle (Slate `#64748B`) states. |
| **🛑 Two-Phase Graceful Close** | Process & AI Tabs | `CloseMainWindow` / `WM_CLOSE` + Tray Detection | **Phase 1**: Dispatches a non-blocking graceful close request and detects if the app minimized to the System Tray (`MainWindowHandle == IntPtr.Zero`). **Phase 2**: Prompts for force termination only if the process remains active or unresponsive. |
| **⚡ Reverse Tree Kill** | AI Agents Tab | Reverse Topological Tree Termination + `(PID, StartTime)` Identity Gate | Terminates entire process trees in reverse topological order (leaf MCP subprocesses first $\rightarrow$ root CLI last) eliminating orphaned background processes and memory leaks. The walk refuses to descend into a process that started *before* its recorded parent, so a live process that merely inherited a recycled parent PID is never dragged into someone else's tree. |
| **🧟 Orphan Detection & Cleanup** | AI Agents Tab | Toolhelp32 Claim Diff + Dead/Recycled Parent Test + Minimum Age Gate | Lists runtime processes (`python`, `node`, `docker`, shells…) that **no live agent session claims** and whose parent is either gone or was recycled onto a different process — what an interrupted session leaves behind, such as a `multiprocessing.Pool` whose workers outlived the run. Windows has no orphan reaper, so these accumulate silently across retries. Each row shows the detection reason, age and RAM, with the sanitized command line in the tooltip; nothing is ever terminated automatically, and both the per-row and "Terminate All" actions revalidate each PID's `StartTime` before killing. |
| **🌐 Flush DNS** | Top Ribbon | Native `dnsapi.dll` (`DnsFlushResolverCache`) | Directly purges and resets the Windows DNS name resolver cache in 0.01 ms, resolving stale routes, domain lookup glitches, and network timeouts without needing CMD. |
| **🧹 Clean Temp** | Top Ribbon | Multizone `SafeTempCleaner` (>24h Cutoff) | Safely cleans obsolete cache files in `%TEMP%`, `C:\Windows\Temp`, `WinSxS\Temp`, `SoftwareDistribution\Download`, and `DeliveryOptimization`. Protected by **NTFS Reparse Point (Junction/Symlink) isolation** and **Dual Timestamp Gate** (`CreationTime` + `LastWriteTime`). |
| **🔍 Storage Scan** | Drives Tab | `FolderSizeScanner` + `IProgress<T>` / `CancellationToken` | Measures the recursive size of every first-level folder under a chosen root and ranks the heaviest, answering *where* the space went instead of only how full the volume is. Subtrees are walked in parallel, progress is throttled to one report per 150 ms, and the scan is cancellable mid-run. Reparse points are reported as skipped and **never contribute bytes**. |
| **🔎 Bloat Analysis** | Drives Tab | `BloatDetector` + `SHQueryRecycleBin` | Surfaces large consumers a per-volume bar cannot show: dynamically grown Docker/WSL VHDX files, regenerable build caches (Gradle, NuGet, npm, pip, Maven, Android), the Recycle Bin, the paging/hibernation files and the WinSxS component store — each classified by severity with a concrete remediation. |
| **🧹 Clean Cache** | Bloat Row | Whitelist-validated `SafeTempCleaner.CleanWhitelistedCache` | Deletes a regenerable cache only after an **exact match against an explicit whitelist**; arbitrary paths are refused. Inherits the dual-timestamp age gate and never follows junctions. System-owned items expose no delete action at all. |
| **⚠️ Rescue Process** | Dynamic Title Alert | Win32 `IsResponding` Watchdog + Two-Phase Close | Real-time watchdog detects windowed processes that stop responding to the Windows message loop (`IsResponding == false`). Clicking *"Rescue"* dispatches a safe two-phase close. |
| **⏸️ Suspend Process** | Process List / Context | Kernel `ntdll.dll` (`NtSuspendProcess`) | Freezes all execution threads of a CPU-intensive or runaway background task, dropping its CPU consumption to 0.0% instantly without closing the window or losing unsaved work. |
| **▶️ Resume Process** | Process List / Context | Kernel `ntdll.dll` (`NtResumeProcess`) | Safely reactivates a suspended process, restoring its threads to active scheduling immediately. |
| **🚨 Resume All** | Process Tab Toolbar | Batch `NtResumeProcess` Watchdog | Global emergency safety button that immediately unfreezes all currently suspended user processes. |
| **⚡ CPU Priority Selector** | Context Menu | Win32 `ProcessPriorityClass` (`SetPriorityClass`) | Modifies the Windows CPU scheduler priority in real time (`Realtime`, `High`, `AboveNormal`, `Normal`, `BelowNormal`, `Idle`) to prioritize gaming, compiling, or rendering. |
| **🔍 Real-Time Search** | Process Tab Toolbar | 200 ms Debounced Filter | Reactively filters active tasks by executable name, PID, or friendly business metadata without UI thread jitter. |
| **⚡ Fast In-Memory Sorting** | Process Tab Toolbar | `ApplyProcessSortingFast` + `_syncLock` | Instantly toggles between CPU % and RAM (MB) descending sorts in-memory without blocking the UI thread or triggering redundant OS process enumeration. |
| **🎛️ Interactive Bento Cards** | Main HUD Dashboard | WPF Event Routing & Filter Dispatcher | Clicking any Bento tile (CPU, RAM, GPU, Disk, Network) redirects directly to the detailed view and applies the relevant sorting filter. |
| **🧮 Per-Core CPU Load** | CPU Bento Card | Kernel `ntdll.dll` (`NtQuerySystemInformation`, `SystemProcessorPerformanceInformation`) | Shows one load bar per logical processor and how many cores are actually in use (busy ≥ 10% of the sample interval), not just the aggregate %. |
| **⚡ Trim RAM** | Memory Card / Tray | Win32 `SetProcessWorkingSetSize` / `EmptyWorkingSet` | Trims unreferenced memory pages from the process working set and executes CLR Garbage Collection. |
| **📌 Always on Top (Pin)** | Window Titlebar | WPF `Topmost` Property Toggle | Pins the telemetry window above fullscreen apps, games, or IDEs for uninterrupted monitoring. |
| **🗖 Seamless Maximization** | Window Controls | Native Win32 `WM_GETMINMAXINFO` Hook | Intercepts `0x0024` message and calculates work area via `MonitorFromWindow`, eliminating taskbar clipping and multi-monitor bleed on borderless custom chrome. |
| **🎨 4 Modern Themes** | Titlebar Palette | `ActivePillActionButtonStyle` & Dynamic Resources | Instantly swaps between **Pastel Dark**, **Pastel Light**, **Cyberpunk Neon**, and **Sakura Rose** with dynamically themed vector buttons. |

### 3. Key Highlights & Capabilities:
- **🤖 AI Agent & MCP Session Monitor:** Real-time discovery and consolidated telemetry of developer AI sessions, resumed session identification via CLI hash/UUID (`--resume=`, `🔗 Sesión <8-char-hash>`), dynamic AI model badges (`--model`, `🧬 <ModelName>`) with null/empty-safe WPF DataTriggers, decoupled MCP vs. child counters, Toolhelp32 snapshot failure resilience (`allRunningPids.Count > 0`), cold-start PEB resilience, and dynamic Active/Idle state badges.
- **⚡ Zero-Leak Handle Architecture & Concurrency Guard:** Deterministic disposal of Win32 process handles (`SafeProcessHandle` via `using`/`Dispose()`) and anti-reentrancy synchronization (`_sampleGate`) for rock-solid CPU delta calculations under high-frequency polling.
- **🛡️ Two-Phase Graceful Close Protocol:** Safe non-blocking process termination with System Tray minimization detection and topological tree kill.
- **🧟 Orphan Detection Without Auto-Kill:** Surfaces the runtime processes an interrupted agent session abandoned — unclaimed by any live session, parent dead or recycled, older than the launcher-exit grace window — and leaves the decision to you, showing the reason, age, RAM and sanitized command line behind an explicit confirmation.
- **Responsive 100% Full-Width Bento Grid:** Eliminates dead UI margins, delivering clean, high-density telemetry across all monitor aspect ratios.
- **Enterprise Crash Logging & Exception Traps:** Centralized `CrashLogger` captures unhandled domain exceptions, unobserved task faults, and recoverable UI dispatcher errors with a 1MB size cap, sliding rate limiting, and log rotation.
- **Dedicated Multi-Drive Storage Hub:** Live partition visualizer with filesystem health, drive type detection (NVMe/SSD/HDD), activity meters, and 1-click Explorer shortcuts.
- **🔍 Storage Analyzer & Hidden Bloat Detection:** On-demand folder-size breakdown with parallel subtree walking, throttled progress and mid-run cancellation, plus detection of the space consumers a usage bar structurally cannot reveal — grown Docker/WSL virtual disks, regenerable build caches, the Recycle Bin, and system-owned paging/hibernation files labeled as such so they are never chased in vain.
- **☁️ Cloud Mount Disambiguation:** Virtual drives that Windows reports as fixed disks (Google Drive and similar) are badged and excluded from every storage calculation, so a mount mirroring the host volume never double-reports the machine's real capacity.
- **🔍 360° Process Inspector & Metadata Resolver:** Resolves human-readable application names (`FileDescription`), verified publishers (`CompanyName`), architectures, and window titles with 0ms cache overhead.
- **Protected System Process Blacklist:** Hardened guardrails strictly prevent accidental termination or suspension of essential operating system services (`csrss`, `dwm`, `svchost`, `explorer`, `services`, `lsass`).
- **ICMP Ping Latency Monitor:** Constant background network latency measurement without UI locking.
- **Diagnostic Snapshot Exporter:** Generates full Markdown health reports with one click for sharing or debugging.

### 6. Key Learnings & Engineering Takeaways
1. **AI Agent & MCP Process Tree Discovery & Subprocess Classification:** Using `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` enables atomic process hierarchy mapping in $<0.8\text{ ms}$. Accurately classifying child processes requires inspecting command-line markers (`--stdio`, `mcp-remote`, `modelcontextprotocol`, `/mcp`) rather than relying on host runtimes (`node.exe`, `python.exe`), enabling discovery of compiled Go and Rust MCP servers while discarding generic build tools or language servers. Separating total child processes (`ChildProcessCount`) from verified MCP servers (`McpServersCount`), isolating ephemeral package runners (`npx`, `uvx`), promoting nested CLI agent sessions to their own roots with session-boundary tree pruning, wrapping native process handles in deterministic `SafeProcessHandle` disposals (`using`/`Dispose()`), and guarding time-series CPU deltas with re-entrancy locks (`_sampleGate`) eliminates handle table exhaustion and metric duplication across parent IDEs and child sessions.
2. **Triple PID Reuse Mitigation Gate:** Windows reassigns PIDs rapidly upon process termination. Storing and verifying `child.StartTime >= parent.StartTime.AddSeconds(-2)` prevents false-positive parent-child associations when examining long-running developer sessions.
3. **Two-Phase Termination & Reverse Topological Tree Termination:** When closing complex applications, Phase 1 dispatches non-blocking graceful close signals (`CloseMainWindow` / `WM_CLOSE` / `AttachConsole` + `CTRL_C_EVENT`) and detects if the window minimized to the System Tray (`MainWindowHandle == IntPtr.Zero`). Escalating to Phase 2 terminates child MCP leaves before root CLI orchestrators, eliminating orphaned background processes and locked ports.
4. **Anti-Reparse Point / Junction Security:** Traditional recursive directory cleaners follow NTFS Junction Points and Symlinks into user data folders. Validating `FileAttributes.ReparsePoint` and enforcing dual timestamps (`CreationTime` + `LastWriteTime`) provides absolute sandbox isolation.
5. **Kernel-Level Thread Suspension (`ntdll.dll`):** Invoking `NtSuspendProcess` and `NtResumeProcess` directly allows freezing resource-hogging background tasks without corrupting their state or losing application sessions.
6. **Seamless Multi-Monitor Window Maximization (`WM_GETMINMAXINFO`):** Handling Win32 `0x0024` and extracting per-monitor work area dimensions via `MonitorFromWindow` eliminates window clipping across high-DPI and multi-monitor setups.
7. **Resilient Crash Trapping Architecture (`CrashLogger.cs`):** Multi-tier exception hooking across `AppDomain`, `TaskScheduler`, and `Dispatcher` with 1MB size caps and 5-log/10s rate limiting prevents diagnostic spam and application crashes from unobserved background threads.
8. **Resilient Session Context & Cache Eviction Safeguards:** Headless or resumed autonomous CLI agents frequently lack window titles; System Core Monitor resolves these via regex CLI inspection (`--resume=`) into compact session hashes (`🔗 Sesión <8-char-hash>`) and extracts active AI models (`--model`) displayed as `🧬 <ModelName>`. In WPF XAML, dual null-and-empty `DataTriggers` (`Value=""` and `Value="{x:Null}"`) guarantee seamless visual collapse when no model flag exists. Crucially, cache eviction passes across CPU delta histories, resolved session metadata, and UI collapse states (`CollapsedSessionPids`) are protected behind an `allRunningPids.Count > 0` boundary check, preventing catastrophic cache purges if a transient OS snapshot call fails under high resource contention.
9. **Recursive Enumeration Cannot Use `SearchOption.AllDirectories`:** `EnumerateFiles`/`EnumerateFileSystemInfos` with `AllDirectories` raises `UnauthorizedAccessException` from *inside* the deferred iterator, aborting the entire walk with no way to skip the offending branch and resume — a single protected folder silently truncates a whole-drive scan. The same applies to `PathTooLongException` on deeply nested dependency trees. Correct traversal is manual recursion over `TopDirectoryOnly` with per-directory exception handling, guarding `MoveNext()` itself, so one unreadable directory costs that directory and nothing more.
10. **Reparse Points Invent Storage That Does Not Exist:** Junctions, symlinks and cloud placeholders project data that lives elsewhere — another volume, a remote service, or a paired mobile device. Any size aggregation that follows them reports space the physical volume does not contain, and the error is large enough to dominate a report. Every traversal must test `FileAttributes.ReparsePoint`, exclude those entries from all totals, and surface them as explicitly *skipped* so the discrepancy between a scan total and the volume's used space is visible rather than mysterious. The attribute check must fail closed: if attributes cannot be read, assume a reparse point and refuse to descend.
11. **A Fixed FAT32 Volume Above 32 GB Is Impossible:** Windows refuses to format FAT32 beyond 32 GB, so a drive simultaneously reporting `DriveType.Fixed`, FAT32 and a capacity above that cap is a cloud or virtual mount surfacing through a filesystem filter, not physical storage. Such mounts typically mirror the host volume's capacity, so counting them double-reports the machine's real storage. Checking whether the drive root is a reparse point does *not* detect them — the mount presents a normal root directory.
12. **Windows Never Clears a Recorded Parent PID, So a Process Tree Is Not What `PPID` Says It Is:** A process keeps its parent's PID long after that parent dies, and Windows hands the freed number to something new. Walking `PPID` edges therefore reaches live, unrelated processes that merely inherited the number — measurable at any moment on a normal desktop, and dense precisely where orphans are, since old abandoned processes are the ones most likely to hold a recycled number. The invariant that restores the real tree is that **a process cannot start before its own parent**: an edge whose child predates its parent is an artifact and must not be traversed. This matters most on the destructive path, where a wrong edge does not display a bad number, it kills someone's work. For the same reason a PID captured in a previous sample is revalidated against its `StartTime` immediately before terminating: between the scan, a modal confirmation and a bulk loop that waits on each exit, the number can change owner.
13. **Dynamically Expanding Virtual Disks Never Shrink:** VHDX files backing Docker Desktop's WSL2 engine and WSL distributions grow as data is written but do not release blocks when it is deleted. The file size on disk therefore says nothing about how much is stored inside, and reclaiming the space requires compacting the image rather than deleting anything. Reporting the file size alone is honest and useful; inferring internal usage would require mounting the image or depending on an external CLI, neither of which belongs in a dependency-free binary.
